# AWS and Terraform
## About the project
In this repo we are going to create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) on AWS is an isolated virtual network in the cloud. This will allow us to define a network topology, including IP addresses, subnets and route tables. Also, we will include the technology Terraform for can create and destroy resources with block programming.

## Things you will need
Recommendation: Is a pretty good idea to use Linux and the distribution Ubuntu for this project, this is going to make the things easier for coding in terraform.
### Credentials
First, you will need lo link your AWS credentials to the CLI that you are going to use. This is necessary, because it will allow us to create the resources instantly in AWS.
### Terraform
Once you had done the previous step, you need to configure the VPC and all his settings. Then in the CLI you can put these commands:

1. `terraform init`: Inicializa el directorio de trabajo.
2. `terraform validate`: Valida la configuraci√≥n de Terraform.
3. `terraform plan`: Planifica cambios de infraestructura.
4. `terraform apply`: Aplica cambios planificados.
5. `terraform destroy`: Destruye la infraestructura creada.
